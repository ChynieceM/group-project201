## Conflict Plan
Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

Make sure we are listening to each other and working through our issues while trying to reach an end result. Focus on effective communication and come together to talk about things. 

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

We will all be self aware and hold each other accountable and ourselves accoutable. We will also lift up our teamates if they are struggling and help each other out.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

Since we all know our strengths and weaknesses, we can distribute the work accordingly; we will help each other as needed. 

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Just communicate with one another and communicate with our instructors as well; hold each other accountable.

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

We could take a vote on ideas or ask a TA or instructor to step in when we've exhausted every possible option we can think of. 

## Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?

During class and a few hours outside of class. 
Chyniece: Mon-Wed 5-7pm, Th/Fri 7-9; Open on the weekends

Kaydee: 
Daron: M-F 6:30- whenever; weekends fluctuates

2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Discord, slack, whatsapp

2. How often will you take breaks?

Lunch and at least 1 hour after class ends; 

3. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Call an accoutablilty partner and see how we can evenly distribute the work so that it can get done. 

4. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Discord, slack, whatsapp

5. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

We will vote on ideas, hold space for everyone's thoughts and opinions, and not be as judgemental.

6.  How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
Not being judgemental and respecting everyones time and opinions.

## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

Describe at least:

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Check our repos and make sure we are priortizing our strengths/tasks and checking in with each other. 

2. What project management tool will be used?

Canvas calendar, google calendar, and slack

## Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?

-All of it; besides the wireframe

2. How will you share the repository with your teammates?

We are all added as collaborators and we will each make a new branch to avoid merge conflicts

3. What is your Git flow?

A-C-P; also creating pull requests. We should communicate before changes are complete and do a final merge.

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
How many people must review a PR?
-Who merges PRs?
-How often will you merge?
-How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

Who ever creates the repo should be the one to do the final merge. However, we will each have a voice on the final changes. We will merge once the code is working.
